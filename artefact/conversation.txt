YOU: I want a movie like Batman
BOT:  Sure! Batman is a classic superhero movie that follows the adventures of Bruce Wayne and his ward Robin as they fight against crime in Gotham City. The story revolves around a Japanese sabotage ring operating in the city, and Bruce's girl friend who asks for his help in finding her uncle who was abducted by the ring. Batman discovers the plot to steal the city's radium supply and eventually routs the gang after a terrific battle. Would you like me to recommend another movie?

YOU: I already watched it, give me a similar movie
BOT:  Sure! Another movie that is similar to Batman would be The Dark Knight. It follows Bruce Wayne as he battles against the Joker and his henchmen in Gotham City. The story revolves around the Joker's plan to steal the city's money supply, and Bruce's efforts to stop him. The movie features intense action scenes and a gripping plot that will keep you on the edge of your seat. Would you like me to recommend another movie?
